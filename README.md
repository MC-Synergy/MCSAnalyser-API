# MCS Analyser API
This is the API of the Analyser app for the MCS server.

## Education
This project is being made by Vincent Vermeire. A student at Fontys ICT & Software Engineering.
During semester 3 I had to make a fullstack web app, build a CI/CD pipeline and assure
my projects quality by performing integration tests and research. For more information, please
take a look at my portfolio: PLACE LINK TO PORTFOLIO

## What is the analyser for?
The Analyser makes it possible to analyse data produced by systems on the
MCS Minecraft server. The MCS Systems make use of little robots called
turtles. These turtles are part of a mod called MCS-CC (Just another Computercraft fork).
